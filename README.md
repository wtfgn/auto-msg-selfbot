# Discord Chat Room Self-bot
This allows you to login as a bot or a user, and you can send message just like on Discord.

## Installation
For this bot to work, please include the .env file in the root folder, and put your token there.

    TOKEN = 'Your token here'
    IS_BOT = "True/False"

## How to use
```console
yarn build
yarn start
```
The link would be `http://localhost:3000/`.
Then you can see the page.

## Reminder
Please be reminded that, any self-bot violates the Discord TOS.
If you are putting your user token, this could be dangerous, and I recommend against it.
You have to bare any consequence yourself, if you insist on do that.
